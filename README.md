# APEXPLANET-task2

Over the past few weeks during my internship with ApexPlanet, I worked on hands-on frontend development tasks to strengthen my core web skills. Today, I’m excited to share two mini projects I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:


✅ 1. Advanced To-Do List Web App


🧾 A smart and fully interactive task management application built with:

🧱 Techologies used:

>>HTML – Structured content layout

>>CSS – Clean and responsive UI with gradients, rounded corners, and media queries

>>JavaScript – DOM manipulation and dynamic task controls

>>Font Awesome – Task control icons for better UX


🔑 Features:

➕ Add tasks dynamically

✅ Mark tasks as complete (strikethrough with color change)

✏ Edit tasks with a prompt-based input

🗑 Delete tasks instantly

🎨 Stylish and responsive design — looks great on desktop and mobile


💡 Skills Gained:

>>JavaScript DOM operations (createElement, appendChild, classList.toggle)

>>Event handling for user interactions

>>UI/UX principles for usability and clean design

>>Responsive design using Flexbox and media queries


📬 2. Responsive Contact Form with Validation


📨 A user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing contact form designed to collect user information efficiently.

🧱 Techologies used:

>>HTML – Input fields for name, email, subject, message

>>CSS – Visually appealing layout using grid and flexbox

>>JavaScript – Client-side validation + success message

>>Font Awesome – Icon-enhanced inputs for modern UI


✨ Features:

🎯 Input types: text, email, message area

🔒 Basic form validation (empty fields, email format)

✅ Shows “Message sent successfully” confirmation

📱 Fully responsive for all device sizes

💬 Enhanced user experience with focus animations


💡 Skills Gained:

>>Validating forms without external libraries

>>Using pseudo-classes (:focus, :invalid) for better accessibility

>>Creating reusable input components

>>Implementing real-time UX feedback


🚀 Outcomes:

These projects sharpened my JavaScript fundamentals, improved my understanding of responsive design, and helped me write clean, modular, and interactive frontend code. They also taught me how small details (icons, transitions, focus states) can dramatically improve user experience.
